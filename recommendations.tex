If you want to learn more about functional programming, I recommend you read some functional programming books, like
\keyword{Learn You a Haskell For Great Good} by Miran Lipovaca, or \keyword{Functional Programming in Scala} by Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason. 
Note that both of these books use non-Lisp dialects (the first one uses Haskell, and the second one uses Scala). However, the lessons you will learn
from these books are applicable to any functional languages, including Meruem.

If s-expression programming is your cup of tea, you can read some Lisp books, such as \keyword{The Joy of Clojure} by Chris Houser. As mentioned before, Clojure
is another Lisp dialect, just like Meruem.

Happy readings!
