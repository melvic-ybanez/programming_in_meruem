There are many people who were kind enough to help me in completing this book. I would like to thank all of them.

The dean of College of Computer Studies department, Dr. Melvin Ni√±al, believed in me and challenged me to write this tutorial. If it wasn't for that challenge, you wouldn't be reading this book by now.

My adviser, Ms. Sheryl Satorre, was always there to ensure that I could complete this writing before the deadline comes. This woman is always busy, yet she still finds time to check her advisees works (including mine), because she doesn't want them to fail. 

Mr. Alex William Montecalvo made sure that I was doing the right thing when I was writing this tutorial. He was the technical editor. He spent hours reading this book, and looking for errors.

My friends and family were extremely supportive. It was their compliments that made me feel like I was writing something that is worth reading.
