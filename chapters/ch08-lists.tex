You already know what Meruem lists are and how they are evaluated by the interpreter. However, you haven't tasted its real power yet. In this chapter, you are going to see what makes lists so useful.

\section{Parts of a List}
As discussed in the past chapters, a \code{list} is composed of zero, one or more elements, each can either be an atom or another list. The question is --- how do we access those elements? 

There are four major parts of a list: \code{head}, \code{tail}, \code{last}, \code{init}. Let us briefly define each one of them:

\begin{description}
	\codedesitem{head} returns the first element of a non-empty list.
	\codedesitem{tail} returns all but the first element of a non-empty list.
	\codedesitem{last} returns the last element of a non-empty list.
	\codedesitem{init} returns all but the last element of a non-empty list.
\end{description}

The following example shows how to use each of them:

\begin{REPL}
meruem> (def xs '(1 2 3 4 5))
nil
meruem> (head xs)
1
meruem> (tail xs)
(2 3 4 5)
meruem> (lists.last xs)
5
meruem> (lists.init xs)
(1 2 3 4)
\end{REPL}

As shown in the example, both \code{last} and \code{init} are members of the \code{lists} module. The reason we didn't have to import it is because it's already been imported in the \code{prelude}.

\section{Searching for an element}
There are three main ways to see if an element exists within a list. Each of them are members of the lists module. Here they are together with their corresponding definitions:

\begin{description}
	\codedesitem{lists.contains?} checks if an expression has the same value as at least one of the elements of a list.
	\codedesitem{lists.exists?} checks if an expression is similar to at least one of the elements of a list based on a particular predicate.
	\codedesitem{lists.find} the same as \code{lists.exists?} except that it returns the first element for which the predicate returns true, instead of a boolean value (which is why it doesn't have a \code{?} at the end of it's name). If no element is found, it returns \code{nil}.
\end{description}

Examples:

\begin{REPL}
meruem> (def xs '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10))
nil
meruem> (lists.contains? xs 3)
true
meruem> (lists.contains? xs 11)
false
meruem> (lists.contains? () 3)
false
meruem> (lists.exists? xs odd?)
true
meruem> (lists.exists? xs (lambda (x) (< x 10)))
true
meruem> (lists.find xs even?)
2
meruem> (lists.find xs (lambda (x) (> x 10)))
nil
\end{REPL}

\code{lists.find} would apply the predicate --- like \code{(lambda (x) (> x 10))} to each of the elements of the list. The first element that satisfies the predicate would be returned. Same thing can be said to \code{lists.exists?}. The only difference between \code{lists.find} and \code{lists.exists?} is the return value.
