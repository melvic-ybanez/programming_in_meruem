In this chapter, we are going to focus the discussion on the structure of Meruem code. We are going to talk about it's odd-looking syntax, and why it is something you should try to embrace rather than avoid. Let us start the discussion with the main (and probably the only) syntax component of a Meruem program: \keyword{S-expressions}

\section{S-expressions}
The syntax of Meruem code is composed only of s-expressions. In fact the syntax for the whole program itself is an s-expression. So the key to mastering the syntax of Meruem is to learn how s-expressions work. The good news is it's actually pretty easy to learn s-expressions. So what is an s-expression?

An \ikeyword{s-expression} (or \code{sexprs})is a recursive tree-like data structure whose \keyword{leaf sub-nodes} are \keyword{atoms} and the non-\keyword{leaf sub-nodes} are themselves s-expressions. 
(A \keyword{leaf} node is a node that doesn't have any children.) In other words, an s-expression can be either an atom (the smallest unit of expression in Meruem), or a composition of other s-expressions (like I said, it's recursive). 

I'm sure you're already familiar with \code{atom}s, but just to refresh your memory let's see some of them again:

\begin{REPL}
meruem> 10            
10
meruem> 30@l
30
meruem> 50.79@f
50.79
meruem> 70@d
70.0
meruem> \c
\c
meruem> cons
<function>
meruem>   
\end{REPL}

Again, atoms are the first type of s-expression. The second one has the following structure: 

\begin{QuasiLang}
(elem1 elem2 elem3)
\end{QuasiLang}

where \code{elem1}, \code{elem2}, and \code{elem3} are all s-expressions. Does it look familiar? That's right! It looks like a \code{list}. This is why in the previous chapter, I mentioned that the Meruem program itself can be considered as a list. The following expressions are s-expressions that are not atoms:

\begin{REPL}
meruem> (list 1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
meruem> (list "the quick brown" (list \f \o \x))
(the quick brown (f o x))
meruem> (++ "I want" "cookies")
"I wantcookies"
meruem> 
\end{REPL}

It is worth noting that this type of s-expressions and lists are not always the same. A list is a data structure, while an s-expression refers to the syntax itself. For instance, consider the expression \code{(+ 1 2 4)}. If you run it in the REPL, you'll get \code{7} as a result. So, the expression \code{(+ 1 2 4)} is an s-expression but you wouldn't call it a list. It is a number, just like $1 + 3$ is a number expressed as the sum of $1$ and $3$. In other words, the type of the expression is the type of the value returned when we evaluate it. On the other hand, the expression \code{(list 1 2 3)} is an s-expression and a list, because the value it returns when evaluated, which is \code{(1 2 3)}, is a list. The difference between s-expression and list, however, does not invalidate the claim that Meruem programs are just lists. Internally, everything is still a list. Also, you can capture an entire expression (an s-expression) without evaluating it, effecting treating it as an ordinary list. For this reason, the two terms can be used almost interchangeably.

\section{Callable expressions}
Not all s-expressions (or lists) can be evaluated. For instance, if you are going to evaluate \code{(1 2 3)}, you'll get an error:

\begin{REPL}
meruem> (1 2 3)
An error has occurred. 1 can not be converted to a function.
Source: .home.melvic.meruem.meruem.prelude [1:2}]
(1 2 3)
 ^
\end{REPL}

So why can we evaluate \code{(list 1 2 3)} and not \code{(1 2 3)}? The error message from the last example made it sound like the interpreter was expecting for the first element of the list to be a function. And that's, indeed, what was happening. To be more accurate, the interpreter requires that the first element of a list should be a \keyword{callable}. A callable is a thing that can be applied to some parameters, like a function, operator, special commands, macros, and more. An expression whose first element is a callable is known as a \keyword{callable expression}. The syntax of a callable expression looks like this:

\begin{QuasiLang}
(callable-name param1 param2 param3 ...)
\end{QuasiLang}

\code{callable-name} refers to the name of the callable (like \code{list} or \code{++}). The \code{...} indicates that the number of parameters (or \keyword{params}) are not limited to only 3. Let's have some examples (you've already seen some of them):

\begin{REPL}
meruem> (list \c \d)
(c d)
meruem> (+ 6 7 (- 9 20))
2
meruem> (cons \m "eruem")
"meruem"
\end{REPL}

In Meruem, most of the callables are effectively functions. An operator like \code{+} is just a function who happened to have that operator-looking name. (In many languages, naming a function like this is not possible.). Macros are also just special functions, internally. Most of the special commands behave like functions as well. In fact, I rarely use the term "callable" in Meruem. I just refer to these things as "function"s. So does the interpreter (see the last error message). You'll learn more about functions in the later part of the book.
