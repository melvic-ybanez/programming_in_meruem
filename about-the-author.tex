\ikeyword{Melvic Yba√±ez} is the creator of the Meruem programming language. He spends most of his time reading and/or writing computer programs, or sitting in front of the computer pretending to write programs so other people won't bother him. He has studied many programming languages (e.g. Scala, Haskell, Java, C, Python, etc.) and different programming paradigms. When it comes to solving programming problems, he prefers the more mathematical approach (functional programming) rather than the algorithmic or logical one (imperative programming).
